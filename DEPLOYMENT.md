## üìã Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] Code is pushed to GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] All dependencies are in `package.json`
- [ ] Build command works locally: `npm run build`
- [ ] Start command works: `npm start`
- [ ] No hardcoded localhost URLs in code

## üîß Environment Variables

The app works without environment variables, but you can set:

- `NODE_ENV=production` (automatically set by most platforms)
- `PORT` (automatically set by most platforms)

## üí° Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Use Free Tiers First:** Vercel and Netlify offer generous free tiers
2. **Static Hosting:** Consider converting to a pure client-side app for even cheaper hosting
3. **CDN Benefits:** Most platforms include global CDN for faster loading
4. **Auto-scaling:** Serverless functions scale to zero when not in use

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check Node.js version compatibility (app uses Node 18+)
- Verify build command: `npm run build`

### App Won't Start
- Check start command: `npm start`
- Ensure port is configurable: `process.env.PORT || 5000`
- Verify all files are included in deployment

### API Routes Not Working
- Check platform-specific routing configuration
- Ensure API routes are properly configured in deployment settings
- Verify serverless function setup for platforms like Vercel/Netlify

## üìû Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check platform-specific documentation
2. Verify the app runs locally with `npm run dev`
3. Check deployment logs in your platform's dashboard
